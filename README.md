# php-pdo

Welcome to my repository, I am a junior web developer in training at Be/Code and I am currently learning about how to deal with sql database. 
This repository contains my exercises about this matter and will be updated according to my exploration of the database and languages.
It currently includes CRUD requests. This repository was first started on January 20th 2023.


# Who Am I

I'm a junior developer currently in training at BeCode and do these exercices as part of my training.


# How to use it ?

To use the forms, you will need a local server or a distant server and a sql database.
